This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript conditional logic related to the handling of the number 0. The original code incorrectly classifies 0 as a positive number instead of considering it separately or as a neutral case. The solution demonstrates a corrected approach that handles 0 appropriately.  The bug is particularly relevant when working with APIs or data that might expect different behavior for 0.
